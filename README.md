# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Budget Planner Categories

The Budget Planner now auto-suggests categories based on your existing expense data and previously created budgets. When adding or editing a budget:

- The category input shows a dropdown of up to 6 matching existing categories as you type.
- Suggestions are built by merging distinct expense categories and current budget categories (case-insensitive deduplication).
- You can still enter a brand new category not in the suggestions; it will then appear in future suggestions after you create its first budget or record an expense with that category.

Implementation details:
`src/context/BudgetContext.js` computes `availableCategories` from `ExpenseContext.expenses` and `budgets`. The UI in `app/(tabs)/budget-planner.js` filters these suggestions as you type.
